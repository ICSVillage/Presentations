# Underway to Identifying Commonalities of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Maritime Transportation System

**Speaker:** Rebecca J. Rohan

# Abstract

The purpose of this study is to identify commonalities in cybersecurity incidents in the maritime transportation system (MTS). For this exploratory study, the researcher expanded upon their previous research into identifying commonalities in cyberattacks by analyzing documents to identify trends concerning all cybersecurity incidents in the civilian and military MTS components. The MTS can use identified commonalities from the expanded study, including all cybersecurity incidents impacting the civilian and military aspects, to make better informed decisions on cybersecurity threats and appropriate measures. In addition to the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis and the information security triadâ€”Confidentiality, Integrity, or Availablity (CIA), this study incorporates additional cybersecurity concepts, such as the Parkerian Hexad and the MITRE ATT&CK framework, to provide more granularity to commonalities identifying in previous research.
