# Where's Waldo? Can you find the Raspberry Pi in the Cyber Defense Exercise? presented by Shane McFly and Brian Howard

**Speaker:** Shane McFly, Brian Howard

# Abstract

The Raspberry Pi was designed to make computing accessible and affordable for everyone. For this reason, it's especially useful in the domain of OT and ICS Security workforce development. In a domain frequently understaffed, underfunded and struggling to find interested, qualified candidates (heck, sometimes even just warm bodies!), budgets are tight if not non-existent when it comes to developing the skills needed to secure these systems. This talk will discuss the use of low-cost computing solutions to deliver learning objectives to everyone from existing professionals in a full-scale OT Cyber Defense Exercise to demonstrating ICS principles to the up-and-coming workforce of tomorrow. We'll show how such devices can pinch hit for GPS to provide NTP, act as a PLC, function as a sync server, replace packet squirrels, act as MITM devices, and even how to use them to model fully functioning cyber physical systems on a shoestring educator's budget. *These statements are the opinions of the researchereducator presenting and have not been approved by Raspberry Pi Foundation.
