# Correlating & contextualizing OT eventsalertslogs using weakly supervised AI

**Speaker:** Ezz Tahoun

# Abstract

"In the complex landscape of modern cybersecurity, identifying coordinated attacks within massive volumes of operational & security data is a formidable challenge. Security professionals often grapple with distinguishing these attacks from numerous false positives and isolated incidents. This talk will illuminate how data science can be harnessed to transform tons of ICS events, logs, and alerts into a bunch of clusters, a few kill chains, and fewer actionable insights, with open-source models.

Join us on a journey to enhance ICS security operations efficacy and efficiency.

In the intricate and ever-evolving landscape of modern cybersecurity, pinpointing coordinated attacks amid vast volumes of security data is an immensely challenging task. Security professionals constantly wrestle with distinguishing genuine threats from a sea of false positives and isolated incidents. This talk will shed light on how data science can be leveraged to transform an overwhelming number of events, logs, and alerts into manageable clusters, insightful kill chains, and actionable insights using open-source models.

Attendees will gain a comprehensive understanding of the necessary steps to preprocess and normalize diverse data sources, map them to standardized threat models, and use AI-driven methods to contextualize and correlate security events. The session will also cover how to generate different types of tickets, such as false positive advisories, incident reports, and detailed attack stories, to streamline response efforts and enhance IT & OT security operations' overall efficacy and efficiency."
