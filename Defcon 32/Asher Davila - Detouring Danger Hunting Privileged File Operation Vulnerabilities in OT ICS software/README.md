# Detouring Danger Hunting Privileged File Operation Vulnerabilities in OT ICS software

**Speaker:** Asher Davila

# Abstract

"The Microsoft Detours library was leveraged to instrument the entire process environment of an engineering workstation in an operational technologyindustrial control system (OTICS) setting. This approach allowed for the comprehensive monitoring and analysis of privileged file operations within these systems. Through this method, multiple vulnerabilities in SCADA software were identified and exploited, demonstrating the effective use of Detours for security research in critical infrastructure contexts.
This presentation will discuss how the custom dynamic-link library (DLL) developed with Detours enabled the systematic examination of file operations, leading to the discovery of security flaws that were then exploited. The talk will showcase these exploitations, providing insight into the types of vulnerabilities that were uncovered and the potential implications for system security. The focus will be on demonstrating the importance of having an effective vulnerability hunting strategy in critical environments and showing real exploitation scenarios of the vulnerabilities found through this method."
