# OT Incident response and Threat Hunting 

**Speaker:** Adam Robbie

# Abstract

"In the rapidly evolving landscape of cybersecurity, operational technology (OT) systems are increasingly becoming prime targets for cyber attacks. As a result, the adoption of effective incident response plans and threat hunting strategies has become essential for organizations to protect their critical OT infrastructure. This presentation will discuss the importance of OT incident response and threat hunting, as well as the challenges faced by the OT industry in implementing these cybersecurity measures.

One of the key challenges in the OT industry is the complexity and interconnectivity of OT systems, which often consist of legacy equipment and proprietary protocols that can be difficult to monitor and secure. Additionally, the lack of visibility into OT networks and the limited availability of skilled cybersecurity professionals with OT expertise pose significant obstacles in detecting and responding to cyber threats in a timely manner. Moreover, the convergence of IT and OT environments further complicates incident response efforts, as organizations must navigate the unique requirements and operational constraints of both domains.

Despite these challenges, we will provide you with tools and frameworks to help overcome them by implementing a proactive approach to incident response and threat hunting in OT environments. This includes conducting architecture, passive, and active defense mechanisms and strategies in the  OT environments. By addressing these challenges head-on and fostering collaboration between IT and OT teams, organizations can enhance their cybersecurity posture and effectively defend against cyber threats targeting their OT systems."
