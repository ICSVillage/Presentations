# A hole in one pwning a cruise ship from a golf simulator and other tales of maritime IT-OT misconvergence

**Speaker:** Andrew Tierney

# Abstract

"Andrew is formally a ships engineer and now spends much of his time pen testing ships. Along the way he's found the weirdest ways that ITOT segregation has been broken, often through 3rd party technology suppliers. From VDRs to ICMS to safety management systems to fire control to azipods to... you name it he's broken it.
Cruising adds another layer of complexity, bringing together customer entertainment, restaurant and billing systems. The scope for segregation errors is multiplied.
The headline of this talk is tale about a misconfigured golf simulator onboard, that led to compromise of almost the entire vessel."
