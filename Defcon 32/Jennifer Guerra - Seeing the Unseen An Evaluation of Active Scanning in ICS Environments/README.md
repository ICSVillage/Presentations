# Seeing the Unseen An Evaluation of Active Scanning in ICS Environments

**Speaker:** Jennifer Guerra

# Abstract

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Clean Energy Cybersecurity Accelerator (CECA) program focuses on accelerating the deployment of innovative OT security solutions in the electric grid. Sponsored by the Department of Energy and utility partners, CECA collaborates with utility sponsors to prioritize cybersecurity gaps and evaluate emerging solutions focused on those gaps. The second cohort of CECA addressed the challenge of OT asset management, particularly incomplete system visibility in Industrial Control Systems (ICS). This presentation covers CECA's evaluation of runZero, a product that enhances asset visibility through active scanning. The evaluation process involved rigorous, repeatable testing in a controlled environment to assess the product's ability to accurately identify devices and its impact on device operation. We will discuss the results of this testing, demonstrating how active scanning can be safe and effective for improving asset visibility. Additionally, we will delve into CECAâ€™s testing philosophy and approach, providing insights into our evaluation process and how it ensures the reliability and efficacy of new cybersecurity solutions.
