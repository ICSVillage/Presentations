# Tracking Industrial Advanced Threat Actors Who Aren't Really Advanced Just Skiddies Who Deface PLCs and Have Bad Manners Methods and Results 

**Speaker:** Ron Fabela

# Abstract

Industrial attacks garner a ton of attention especially from VC funded startups and government agencies who share a common goal - fundraising - I mean protecting our critical infrastructure. Threat actors around the world capitalize on geopolitical unrest and hack our industrial environments, posting screencaps while making wild claims. Both sides have seen an uptick in activity and I've been tracking unreal from reality. Heard of CyBeR AvEnGeRs or the CyBeR ArMy Of RusSiA ReBoRn and their terrifying water utilities hacks? (or not?) I'll deep dive into how these skiddies operate, their communication channels, claims, methods for validating claims, and general debauchery. I have receipts, will spill tea, and in this session will demonstrate for the village the methodsresults of my work so everyone can see for themselves (so they can point and laugh and cry and laugh)
