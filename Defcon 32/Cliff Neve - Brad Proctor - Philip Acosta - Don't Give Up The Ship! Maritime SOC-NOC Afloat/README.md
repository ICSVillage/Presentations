# Don't Give Up The Ship! Maritime SOCNOC Afloat

**Speaker:** Cliff Neve, Brad Proctor, Philip Acosta

# Abstract

Defending a vessel's IT and OT systems while underway can be a matter of life and death. Cliff, Brad, and Phil present a framework for developing 247 network and security operations for vessels, addressing such technical topics as limited bandwidthlatency, detection and response, pre-planned actions, and an underway readiness dashboard. We will address technical and risk-management strategies for a SOC and NOC, including how we use a lab environment to simulate security operations for vessels underway.
