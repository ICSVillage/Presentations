# The People's Republic of Fieldbus What to know about EPA

**Speaker:** Jonathan Reiter

# Abstract

"Ethernet for Plant Automation (EPA) is one of the global variety of IEC 61158 standards, developed as a regionalized versions of Fieldbus standards, used predominantly in industrial settings with prohibitive latency and durability requirements. EPA in particular seems to be used exclusively in the People's Republic of China, and largely for power stations.

In this talk, I will cover the standard through both IEC and GBT documents, both in English and Mandarin, the protocol's history used in sensitive national projects, and what supporting the standard is like. I'll even dive in to some example software and hardware that use the standard, and show some POC code for interacting with EPA devices, should you be lucky enough to find yourself on a network with an EPA-supported router or PLC."
