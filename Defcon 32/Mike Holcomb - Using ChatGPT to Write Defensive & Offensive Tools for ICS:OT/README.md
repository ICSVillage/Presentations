# Using ChatGPT to Write Defensive & Offensive Tools for ICSOT

**Speaker:** Mike Holcomb

# Abstract

During the work on my SANS Master's thesis, I realized two things I am not a developer and ChatGPT makes a pretty good one. Using ChatGPT to write the Python scripts for my research, I started to branch out and use it to write defensive tools such as for identifying unknown assets on the network as a listening service or offensively such as when taking a PLC out of Run mode remotely. If you can think through the process, ChatGPT (or other GenAI) can help you make it a reality. Want to Live off the Land and don't want to download a Python script which might be spotted? Use ChatGPT to convert it to PowerShell on the spot! Receiving error messages from the code it wrote for you? Don't worry - it can fix those issues too! The presentation will walk attendees through prompt creation for two sample coding projects - both with offensivedefensive capabilities, tools that attendees would be able to use back on the job. And, with inspiration, go out and create their own tools!
