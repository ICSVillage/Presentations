# Securing the Harvest Cyber Defense for Agricultural Control Systems

**Speaker:** Ray Baeza

# Abstract

"In the digital age, the agriculture industry has embraced advanced technologies to enhance productivity and efficiency. Central to this transformation are Industrial Control Systems (ICS), which manage everything from irrigation and fertilization to harvesting and storage. However, the integration of ICS in agriculture has also introduced a new vector of vulnerabilities and cyber threats.

This presentation will delve into the critical need to secure ICS in the agriculture sector against an ever-growing array of cyber threats. We will explore the unique challenges that agriculture faces, including the dispersed nature of operations, the integration of legacy systems with modern technologies, and the reliance on remote access and IoT devices."
