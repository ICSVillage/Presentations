# Importance of ICS knowledge from a engineer's perspective

**Speaker:** Ray Baeza

# Abstract

"In the realm of Operational Technology (OT) environments, incident response is a critical function that ensures the continuity and security of industrial processes. A thorough understanding of vendors, asset types, and associated frameworks is indispensable for effective incident management. This talk underscores the significance of this knowledge from an operator's perspective, highlighting how it can substantially enhance the ability of a cyber security analyst to respond to incidents swiftly and efficiently.

Knowing your vendors and the specific types of assets deployed within an OT environment provides a foundational understanding that is crucial during an incident. Cyber Security analyst's equipped with detailed knowledge of where to locate critical configuration files and logs on OT devices can significantly streamline the incident response process. This insight is vital for establishing baselines, which are essential for detecting anomalies and potential threats. When an incident occurs, the ability to swiftly access and analyze these files can make the difference between a contained event and a widespread disruption."
