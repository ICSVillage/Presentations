# Product security considerations for OT security appliances

**Speakers:** Robert Landavazo & Brandon Dudley

# Abstract

The adoption of OT security solutions into the world's most critical infrastructure has increased dramatically. The location in which these appliance reside within control networks poses unique risk as both management interfaces and even more often monitoring interfaces reside within segments that contain critical process automation equipment. This talk will explore essential product security considerations specific to OT security appliances, secure deployment strategies, device and network hardening techniques, and some real-world examples of discovered vulnerabilities in COTS appliances.
