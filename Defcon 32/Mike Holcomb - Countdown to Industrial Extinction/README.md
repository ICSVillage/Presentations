# Countdown to Industrial Extinction
**Speaker:** Mike Holcomb

# Abstract

"ICSOT environments are targets. Since the Colonial Pipeline breach in 2021, the ICSOT threat landscape has changed tremendously. This presentation is not about the Fear, Uncertain and Doubt when an ICSOT environment goes boom, but what happens when it goes down for ten days.  What's the impact to the organization?  It's employees?  The people it serves?

Most importantly, what can we do to prevent it from occurring?  

The remainder of the presentation covers secure network architecture, therapy for IT and OT working together and continually learningimproving."
