# Abstract

We’ve been talking about the gap in ICS cybersecurity features and functions for over a decade, but it seems like we’re always confronting the same set of challenges.  Despite all the progress in products, systems, regulations and oversight it feels like we’re caught in an endless loop of vulnerabilities.  The problem isn’t in a lack of effort on anyone’s behalf it’s in the fundamental market forces that drive the critical infrastructure investments we depend on.  This presentation looks at these forces and shows how to work with them rather than agains them, no matter what your mission might be.
