# Don't Ship Your Bridges! Tools to Explore Wireless Attack Surfaces in Every Ship's Marine Navigation Systems

**Speaker:** Gary Kessler, Nick Haltmeyer, Duncan Woodbury

# Abstract

In collaboration with the legendary Kess, the presenters will demonstrate a FOSS (gnuradio) based SDR tool for accessing and exploring wireless attack surfaces present on every ship and large maritime vessel. We will demonstrate abuse of the AIS protocol to cause various forms of mischief, including causing marine navigation and telemetry systems to hallucinate other major vessels and obstructions.
